				<h2>
					iPhone/iPad
				</h2>
				<p>
					In today's society the smartphone
					controls our lives and the way we
					operate. When you look around everyone
					has a smartphone and they all have a
					similar design and features as each
					other. We can all thank Apple for the
					smartphone industry because Apple
					revolutionized this industry when they
					first came out with the original iPhone
					in 2007 which shocked the technology
					world. From 2007 - present day, Apple
					has created 10 different models of the
					iPhone. Each model is a successor to
					the previous with faster processing
					speed and improved interface and
					design. 2013 began the generation of
					iPhones that were different in sizes
					and models and the public was able to
					choose their preference. Jonathan Ive
					was the designer behind the iPhone
					while Steve Jobs focused all the
					attention towards this project.

					Originally Apple's focus was to design
					a tablet, but it shifted it's focus to
					designing the iPhone. Once the iPhone
					was released and became part of Apple's
					product line, Apple shifted their focus
					back to the tablet project. Apple
					released a tablet computer in 1993
					called the Newton MessagePad 100 but
					was soon discontinued. After the launch
					of the iPhone, Apple shifted their
					focus and re-entered the project to
					create the iPad. The iPad was announced
					in 2010 by Steve Jobs. Since 2010 Apple
					has introduced 9 different models of
					the iPad each improving the previous
					model. In today's society we have iPad
					mini which is a smaller version of the
					original but with the same functions,
					the original iPad but in it's 4th
					generation with a faster processor and
					more features, and the very thin iPad
					air which has the same functionality
					and features as the others but in a
					thinner state.
