					iMac/MacBook
				</h2>
				<p>
					The iMac is an all-in-one macintosh
					computer that was first announced in
					1998. Ken Segall, an employee at an ad
					agency that handled Apple's account,
					came up with the name iMac and Steve
					Jobs grew to love the name. The "i" in
					iMac can stand as individuality or and
					stand as internet, however you like to
					perceive it. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The iMac was the first legacy-free PC
					and used a USB port. After many years
					the iMac has become one of the most
					successful computers in history, and
					it's still improving. Just this year
					the new iMac with 5K display was
					announced!
